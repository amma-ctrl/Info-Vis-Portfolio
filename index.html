							<h1>FINAL PORTFOLIO</h1>
							<p>Welcome to my information visualization portfolio! This collection showcases my growth as a designer and data storyteller, featuring projects that have been thoughtfully reworked based on user research and feedback. From exploring representation in the Smithsonian’s open access collections to diving deep into the Degrees & Disparities project, highlighting the gap between Black women’s graduate degree attainment and leadership roles, I’ve aimed to make complex issues both engaging and accessible. I wrap it all up with a self-assessment reflecting on what I’ve learned, how I’ve grown, and where I’m headed next.</p>

							<h1 class="major">DEGREES & DISPARITIES</br><em>Unpacking Graduate Degree Attainment and Leadership Gaps of Black Women</em></h1>
                            
                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>As a Black woman currently pursuing a graduate degree, I’ve often asked: why doesn’t academic success always translate into leadership opportunity, especially for women who look like me? Before beginning my graduate studies, I encountered research indicating that highly educated Black women are disproportionately underrepresented in leadership roles within academia. That initial finding sparked deeper questions: is this disparity isolated to higher education, or is it part of a broader pattern that spans across industries?</p>
                            
                            <p>This project, Degrees & Disparities, is my attempt to investigate and visualize the structural inequalities between educational achievement and occupational leadership. Using over a decade’s worth of data from the American Community Survey (ACS) via IPUMS USA, I developed a suite of Tableau dashboards that visualize disparities in graduate degree attainment and leadership access. The visual analysis centers Black women but contextualizes their experience within the broader matrix of race, gender, education, and occupation. The aim is not only to measure inequity statistically, but to make it visible and accessible.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Literature and Motivation</h2>
                            <p>Prior studies by the National Center for Education Statistics and scholars like Patricia Hill Collins and Kimberlé Crenshaw have detailed how systems of oppression, specifically racism and sexism, intersect to produce compounding barriers for Black women. Despite rising rates of educational attainment, particularly at the graduate level, Black women remain marginalized in spaces of leadership. These disparities are not just institutional, they’re systemic.</p>
                            
                            <p>Last year, I conducted a statistical analysis that confirmed what I had suspected: even after controlling for education, there is a significant underrepresentation of Black women in leadership roles and a measurable income gap. However, I realized that statistical evidence, while powerful, wasn’t enough. I needed a way to show these disparities in a form that people could see, interact with, and feel. This project is an extension of that impulse, to trace the pathway from education to leadership and reveal the points at which inequities manifest.

                            <h2>Data & Methods</h2>
                            <p>To conduct this analysis, I used microdata from the ACS via the IPUMS USA database, focusing on individuals aged 25 and older from 2010 through 2023. Variables extracted included race, sex, educational attainment, occupation, and annual income. After downloading the data, I processed and cleaned it in R, recoding values into interpretable categories.</p>
                            <p>One of the key challenges was identifying leadership roles. Because the ACS does not include hierarchical job titles explicitly, I used occupation codes and keyword filters (“chief,” “director,” “manager,” “officer,” “executive”) to create a binary leadership indicator. I also created fields to infer industry sectors based on occupation groupings.If you would like to look more into the breakdown of occupations <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z71zMLqKpXTiBQCN-e6C1wbjrAaZ-r8q/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=116402902036445997313&rtpof=true&sd=true">(click here).</a></p>
                            <p>In Tableau, I approached the analysis intersectionally—race and gender were not treated as separate dimensions, but as combined identity groups (e.g., Black women, White men). This allowed for sharper, more targeted comparisons. Several dashboards were built: one examining leadership representation gaps, another isolating Black men and women across industries, a comparison of all women by race, and a time-series showing trends from 2013 to 2023.</p>

							 <h2>Findings</h2>
                            <h4>Leadership Representation Gap</h4>
                            <p>The first visualization I created measures the gap between the share of people with graduate degrees and the share of those holding leadership roles, disaggregated by race and gender. This “representation gap” is a stark indicator of systemic barriers. Black women have the largest negative leadership gap: -11.4%. White women also show a notable gap, though smaller at -8.4%. In contrast, White men are overrepresented in leadership roles relative to their educational attainment, exhibiting a positive gap. These findings show that for some groups, degrees function as gateways to leadership, while for others, especially Black women, they appear to be glass credentials.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Within-Group Analysis of the Black Workforce</h4>
                            <p>A dashboard isolating Black men and women revealed a gendered leadership gap within the Black population. Nationally, Black women hold 4.2% of graduate degrees compared to 2.3% for Black men. However, in leadership roles, that advantage dissipates: 1.7% for Black women and 1.2% for Black men. Despite outperforming their male counterparts educationally, Black women are not advancing proportionately into leadership. Sector-specific breakdowns deepen this insight. In the corporate sector, Black women account for 1.3% of graduate degrees but just 0.3% of leadership roles. Black men, in contrast, earn 1.0% of degrees and hold 0.4% of roles, suggesting a gendered disadvantage for women even within racially marginalized groups. In academia, the trend repeats: Black women hold 1.1% of degrees and just 0.2% of leadership roles. </p>
                            
                            <h4>Comparison of Women by Race</h4>
                            <p>To better understand how race mediates women’s advancement, I created a dashboard comparing all women by race. While all women face underrepresentation in leadership, the magnitude of disparity varies dramatically. White women hold 42.4% of graduate degrees and 19.2% of leadership roles. Black women, by comparison, earn 4.2% of degrees and just 1.2% of leadership positions, three times the disparity. Native American, Latina, and Asian women similarly face underrepresentation, but the scale is most severe for Black women. These disparities challenge the assumption that degrees automatically translate into leadership for all.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Time Trends (2013–2023)</h4>
                            <p>To assess change over time, I built a time-series dashboard plotting graduate degree attainment and leadership roles from 2013 to 2023. For Black women, graduate degree attainment slightly declined from 4.3% to 4.1%, while their leadership share declined from 3.4% to 3.1%. The same trends appeared among multiracial and Asian populations, modest gains in education accompanied by lagging leadership access. White men, while slowly declining in both metrics, continue to dominate leadership across the decade. The alignment between the education and leadership curves for some groups, though faint, suggests potential for improved representation if systemic barriers can be addressed.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Limitations & Reflections</h2>
                            <p>This analysis is limited by the structure of the ACS data. Non-binary gender identities are not represented, and leadership is inferred through occupational title proxies, not self-reported or organizational hierarchy. The broadness of industry classifications also masks sectoral nuances (e.g., healthcare vs. tech within “corporate”). Finally, the data is cross-sectional, not longitudinal, preventing the tracking of individual career trajectories over time.</p>
                            <p>One of the strengths of this project is its visual storytelling. By pairing quantitative data with interactive graphics, the dashboards illuminate disparities in ways raw statistics cannot. Combining multiple axes, such as: race, gender, education, industry, leadership, provides a fuller picture of systemic inequity.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, this project is about more than data. It’s about power, access, and voice. It’s about recognizing that credentials do not always guarantee opportunity, and using visualization to make that inequity not only measurable, but undeniable. My hope is that these tools become a foundation for conversation, accountability, and change.</p>
