							<h1>FINAL PORTFOLIO</h1>
							<p>Welcome to my information visualization portfolio! This collection showcases my growth as a designer and data storyteller, featuring projects that have been thoughtfully reworked based on user feedback. From exploring Smithsonian’s open access collections to diving deep into the Degrees & Disparities project, highlighting the gap between Black women’s graduate degree attainment and leadership roles, I’ve aimed to make complex data both engaging and accessible. I wrap it all up with a self-assessment reflecting on what I’ve learned, how I’ve grown.</p>

                              <h1 class="major" align="right">PIECES IN PLACE</br><em>Mapping Smithsonian Access</em></h1>
							 <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Growing up in DC, the Smithsonian museums were a kind of constant. They were free, they were everywhere, and they made art, science, and history feel easily accessible. As I got older and started working with data, I stumbled upon the <strong><a href="https://www.si.edu/openaccess">Smithsoninan Institution Open Access</a></strong> collection. It was so vast, and I found myself wondering: if the Smithsonian has over 5 million open-access pieces online, where do those pieces actually live? And more importantly, how could that scale of information be made visible or even navigable?</p>
                            
                            <p>That question kicked off a multi-stage process of designing maps that reconnect digital data with physical place. I started with Tableau and recently expanded into ArcGIS, each stage responding to user feedback and design lessons to get closer to something truly usable: a dashboard that not only visualizes where Smithsonian collections are held, but also lets people explore the collections at each location.</p>
                            
                            <h2>The Data Journey</h2>
    <p>I began by pulling records from the Smithsonian Open Access API, aiming for a million, but hitting a ceiling around 600,000 records. The API doesn’t make things easy. Fields are deeply nested, and metadata like race, gender, or even consistent object types aren’t standardized. I had to write custom logic to extract or infer things like collection themes and time periods.</p>
    <p>Even trickier: there was no geospatial data included. So I built that from scratch, collecting addresses for every Smithsonian museum and using R to geocode them into spatial points, essentially hand-stitching a location dataset to the metadata.</p>
  
    <h2>Stage One: Tableau Experiments</h2>
    <p>The first visualization stage lived in Tableau Public. I created a series of interactive maps that tried to answer basic questions:  
    <ul>
      <li>How many pieces are held at each institution?</li>
      <li>What types of objects dominate each collection?</li>
      <li>How do collections differ by time period?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>One of the more popular maps was the proportional symbol map showing total open-access items per institution. But others included pie charts to show temporal spread and filtered views for women-created works.</p>
    <p>But as useful as that was, the Tableau version had limits. The filtering felt clunky, spatial navigation was limited, and the tool wasn't dynamic enough to handle deeper questions from users.</p>

    <p><a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/PiecesinPlaceMappingSmithsonianAccess_17449160318030/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">🔗 View Tableau Dashboard</a></p>

    <h2>Stage Two: Listening to Feedback</h2>
    <p>The feedback was consistent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Curators and fellow spatial analysts wanted to filter collections by identity, object type, or era.</li>
      <li>Teacher feedback was to see more detailed tooltips and equal representation of the institutions to be able to see each location's collection breakdowns.</li>
      <li>Everyday users needed better wayfinding, like recognizing which museums are near each other or learning what kind of work they specialize in.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That pushed me toward a second version—this time, using ArcGIS Dashboards to bring in better filtering, cleaner spatial controls, and more dynamic data views.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stage Three: Building the ArcGIS Dashboard</h2>
    <p>The new ArcGIS interactive dashboard is a direct response to everything I learned building the first round. Now, when a user clicks on any Smithsonian institution, the dashboard generates a location-specific breakdown with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A map that zooms to the museum’s location</li>
      <li>A bar chart showing object types found there</li>
      <li>A timeline that traces the creation dates of those items</li>
      <li>A list view with titles, creators, and descriptions</li>
    </ul>
      
<p>And if you want to just look within the map, when a user clicks on any Smithsonian institution, a popup of the institution address, type, information, outside image, and sample collection are generated.</p>
      
    <p>Behind the scenes, this required creating a related table structure so that each point on the map (each institution) pulls up only the objects tied to that location. It’s all connected: the point, the data, the visuals. The dashboard becomes not just a map, but a portal into the depth of each institution's holdings.</p>

<h2>Dashboard</h2>

                            <p>I am uncertain why the dashboard is not displaying correctly, so please click the link below to see the full dashboard build</p>
                            <h3><a href="https://prattsavi.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/db55b87da2da4d2da30c7716f927ce91">Smithsonian Interactive Dashboard</a></h3>
      
      
    <h2>Understanding the Reach and Representation of Smithsonian Collections</h2>
    <p>This dashboard isn’t just about visualizing collections, it’s about making public institutions feel more public. It shows how collections are distributed, what kinds of stories are being told (or left out), and who those stories center. It invites users to ask:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Which institutions hold the most women-created works?</li>
      <li>Are certain object types clustered in just one museum?</li>
      <li>What time periods dominate the collections?</li>
      <li>Where can I go to see these works in person?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It brings discoverability back into the conversation, not just for digital users, but for people trying to plan visits, design lessons, or investigate representation within cultural spaces.</p>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>There’s still more to do. I want to build out filtered dashboards for underrepresented creators, integrate object images directly into the charts, and add more intuitive legends to guide exploration. I also plan to finalize a system for categorizing the over 10,000 unique object types into digestible themes, which would open up even deeper analysis.</p>
      <p>But even in its current state, this dashboard feels like a step toward transparency, toward making one of the world’s largest museum networks more explorable, understandable, and inviting. Whether you’re a researcher, curator, tourist, or curious kid like I once was, this is a tool to help you find all the pieces in place.</p>

							<h1 class="major">DEGREES & DISPARITIES</br><em>Unpacking Graduate Degree Attainment and Leadership Gaps of Black Women</em></h1>
                            
                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>As a Black woman currently pursuing a graduate degree, I’ve often asked: why doesn’t academic success always translate into leadership opportunity, especially for women who look like me? Before beginning my graduate studies, I encountered research indicating that highly educated Black women are disproportionately underrepresented in leadership roles within academia. That initial finding sparked deeper questions: is this disparity isolated to higher education, or is it part of a broader pattern that spans across industries?</p>
                            
                            <p>This project, Degrees & Disparities, is my attempt to investigate and visualize the structural inequalities between educational achievement and occupational leadership. Using over a decade’s worth of data from the American Community Survey (ACS) via IPUMS USA, I developed a suite of Tableau dashboards that visualize disparities in graduate degree attainment and leadership access. The visual analysis centers Black women but contextualizes their experience within the broader matrix of race, gender, education, and occupation. The aim is not only to measure inequity statistically, but to make it visible and accessible.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Literature and Motivation</h2>
                            <p>Prior studies by the National Center for Education Statistics and scholars like Patricia Hill Collins and Kimberlé Crenshaw have detailed how systems of oppression, specifically racism and sexism, intersect to produce compounding barriers for Black women. Despite rising rates of educational attainment, particularly at the graduate level, Black women remain marginalized in spaces of leadership. These disparities are not just institutional, they’re systemic.</p>
                            
                            <p>Last year, I conducted a statistical analysis that confirmed what I had suspected: even after controlling for education, there is a significant underrepresentation of Black women in leadership roles and a measurable income gap. However, I realized that statistical evidence, while powerful, wasn’t enough. I needed a way to show these disparities in a form that people could see, interact with, and feel. This project is an extension of that impulse, to trace the pathway from education to leadership and reveal the points at which inequities manifest.

                            <h2>Data & Methods</h2>
                            <p>To conduct this analysis, I used microdata from the ACS via the IPUMS USA database, focusing on individuals aged 25 and older from 2010 through 2023. Variables extracted included race, sex, educational attainment, occupation, and annual income. After downloading the data, I processed and cleaned it in R, recoding values into interpretable categories.</p>
                            <p>One of the key challenges was identifying leadership roles. Because the ACS does not include hierarchical job titles explicitly, I used occupation codes and keyword filters (“chief,” “director,” “manager,” “officer,” “executive”) to create a binary leadership indicator. I also created fields to infer industry sectors based on occupation groupings.If you would like to look more into the breakdown of occupations <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z71zMLqKpXTiBQCN-e6C1wbjrAaZ-r8q/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=116402902036445997313&rtpof=true&sd=true">(click here).</a></p>
                            <p>In Tableau, I approached the analysis intersectionally—race and gender were not treated as separate dimensions, but as combined identity groups (e.g., Black women, White men). This allowed for sharper, more targeted comparisons. Several dashboards were built: one examining leadership representation gaps, another isolating Black men and women across industries, a comparison of all women by race, and a time-series showing trends from 2013 to 2023.</p>

							 <h2>Findings</h2>
                            <h4>Leadership Representation Gap</h4>
                            <p>The first visualization I created measures the gap between the share of people with graduate degrees and the share of those holding leadership roles, disaggregated by race and gender. This “representation gap” is a stark indicator of systemic barriers. Black women have the largest negative leadership gap: -11.4%. White women also show a notable gap, though smaller at -8.4%. In contrast, White men are overrepresented in leadership roles relative to their educational attainment, exhibiting a positive gap. These findings show that for some groups, degrees function as gateways to leadership, while for others, especially Black women, they appear to be glass credentials.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Within-Group Analysis of the Black Workforce</h4>
                            <p>A dashboard isolating Black men and women revealed a gendered leadership gap within the Black population. Nationally, Black women hold 4.2% of graduate degrees compared to 2.3% for Black men. However, in leadership roles, that advantage dissipates: 1.7% for Black women and 1.2% for Black men. Despite outperforming their male counterparts educationally, Black women are not advancing proportionately into leadership. Sector-specific breakdowns deepen this insight. In the corporate sector, Black women account for 1.3% of graduate degrees but just 0.3% of leadership roles. Black men, in contrast, earn 1.0% of degrees and hold 0.4% of roles, suggesting a gendered disadvantage for women even within racially marginalized groups. In academia, the trend repeats: Black women hold 1.1% of degrees and just 0.2% of leadership roles. </p>
                            
                            <h4>Comparison of Women by Race</h4>
                            <p>To better understand how race mediates women’s advancement, I created a dashboard comparing all women by race. While all women face underrepresentation in leadership, the magnitude of disparity varies dramatically. White women hold 42.4% of graduate degrees and 19.2% of leadership roles. Black women, by comparison, earn 4.2% of degrees and just 1.2% of leadership positions, three times the disparity. Native American, Latina, and Asian women similarly face underrepresentation, but the scale is most severe for Black women. These disparities challenge the assumption that degrees automatically translate into leadership for all.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Time Trends (2013–2023)</h4>
                            <p>To assess change over time, I built a time-series dashboard plotting graduate degree attainment and leadership roles from 2013 to 2023. For Black women, graduate degree attainment slightly declined from 4.3% to 4.1%, while their leadership share declined from 3.4% to 3.1%. The same trends appeared among multiracial and Asian populations, modest gains in education accompanied by lagging leadership access. White men, while slowly declining in both metrics, continue to dominate leadership across the decade. The alignment between the education and leadership curves for some groups, though faint, suggests potential for improved representation if systemic barriers can be addressed.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Limitations & Reflections</h2>
                            <p>This analysis is limited by the structure of the ACS data. Non-binary gender identities are not represented, and leadership is inferred through occupational title proxies, not self-reported or organizational hierarchy. The broadness of industry classifications also masks sectoral nuances (e.g., healthcare vs. tech within “corporate”). Finally, the data is cross-sectional, not longitudinal, preventing the tracking of individual career trajectories over time.</p>
                            <p>One of the strengths of this project is its visual storytelling. By pairing quantitative data with interactive graphics, the dashboards illuminate disparities in ways raw statistics cannot. Combining multiple axes, such as: race, gender, education, industry, leadership, provides a fuller picture of systemic inequity.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, this project is about more than data. It’s about power, access, and voice. It’s about recognizing that credentials do not always guarantee opportunity, and using visualization to make that inequity not only measurable, but undeniable. My hope is that these tools become a foundation for conversation, accountability, and change.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Self Reflection</h1>
							 <p>Over the course of the semester, I’ve grown a lot, not just in technical skills, but in how I think about visual storytelling, audience, and purpose. I came into this course excited to build new tools and explore new ways to communicate data, but what I gained was a deeper understanding of what makes a visualization work. Through working sessions, presentations, and critiques/feedback from peers and yourself, I’ve learned how to be more intentional with design choices and more responsive to user needs.</p>
                            <p>One of the biggest shifts for me was learning to balance clarity with complexity. In earlier projects, I focused on showing as much as possible, but over time (especially through your feedback), I started focusing more on hierarchy, accessibility, and narrative. My “Degrees & Disparities” work is a good example, I revised it multiple times based on feedback to make it more intuitive, readable, and visually impactful. I also pushed myself technically, using tools like Tableau, ArcGIS, and Gephi in ways I hadn’t before. And tried different writing styles to fit the research I was presenting.</p>
                            <p>I’m especially proud of how my Smithsonian project evolved. It went from a straightforward map to a much more dynamic and layered experience, with pop-ups, filters, and thoughtful design decisions, all informed by yours and user feedback. Overall, I feel like I met the course outcomes and really pushed myself to improve with each project. My final portfolio reflects that growth, and I’ve tried to be responsive, creative, and purposeful throughout. Based on my engagement, progress, and the final work I’m submitting, I would propose an A for my final grade.</p>
